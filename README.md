## About The Project

Unify is a centralized school calendar platform designed to bridge the communication gap between student clubs and the student body.

At Irvington High School, students often struggle to find out when clubs are meeting or how to get involved.
Unify improves this publication gap and student-to-school community opportunity with an intuitive, unified school calendar.

## Key Features

* **Unified Calendar:** A central view of all school events, allowing students to sign up for meetings.
* **Club Directory:** A dedicated list of all available clubs with introductory information.
* **Google Integration:** Seamless Google Sign-in and Google Calendar event integration.
* **AI Assistant:** Integrated chatbot to help students get personalized club recommendations.
