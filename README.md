#COMMUNITY TRACK
## Inspiration
At Irvington High School, clubs are an essential portion of the student community – we have over 95 clubs. And each year, at Maze Day, the main question we hear Freshmen asking is: “What clubs should I join?” At our school, each club has an intro meeting, but if a student misses it (which is often the case for freshmen or for new, less publicized clubs), there’s often not much else they can do to join the club unless their friends notify them for meetings.

## What it does
We plan to improve the publication gap and student-to-school community opportunity with a unified school calendar. It will list dates and times of club meetings, so you can schedule for yourself whether you want to go to CS or Bio club at lunch next week, or whether you’re interested in the boba club fundraiser after school. It will also have other relevant school information, like school spirit days and after school sports games and fundraisers.

## How we built it
We built it on a Firebase server, with two html files: index.html which has the calendar, and clubs.html which has a list of clubs. We wrote a single css and a single javascript file for both of these. We also integrated an LLM chatbot using the ChatGPT API. We have fully functioning google calendar integration for seamless usage.

## Challenges we ran into
- initially, blindly copy-pasting code while vibecoding led to inconsistencies and (usually small) bugs
- google calendar integration was tricky at first

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- our calendar is fully functioning
- we built it without frameworks
- chatbot integration
- instagram embeds
- google calendar integration

## What we learned
- how to develop a website without frameworks
- how to integrate Google signin authentication and calendar integration
- how to integrate an AI chatbot
- how to effectively use AI as a tool for programming rather than an "answer key"

## What's next for Unify
- rewrite UI with React
- implement more robust administrative access management
- pitching our idea to our high school, and other schools too!
